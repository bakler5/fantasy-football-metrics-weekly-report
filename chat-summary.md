# Chat Summary (Private Fork)

This document summarizes the decisions, changes, and debugging insights from our recent working session so it’s easy to resume if the chat context is lost.

## Goals
- Add a robust Weekly Awards section (FA pickups/drops, trades, start/sit) with correct week attribution.
- Improve PDF formatting (wrapping, alignment).
- Implement Season‑to‑Date trade awards accurately (with trade ids and cumulative carry‑forward behavior).
- Make Best of the Rest fast and deterministic via caching.

## What We Implemented

### Week Attribution (Core)
- Build Tuesday→Tuesday week windows from `FetchLeagueScoreboard.schedulePeriod.low.startEpochMilli` (UTC epoch millis).
- Attribute items by epoch→window mapping. If an API ordinal disagrees with the epoch window, the window wins (override logged).
- Off‑season trades (pre‑Week 1 start) are mapped to Week 1 so they start contributing immediately.

### Weekly Awards
- Best/Worst FA Pickup
  - Sources adds/claims from per‑team `FetchLeagueTransactions` and `FetchLeagueActivity`.
  - Excludes players acquired via trade in the same week.
  - Honorable Mention shows only when a benched pickup actually beats (Best) or undercuts (Worst) the started winner.
  - Player name resolution searches current/previous rosters, current FA cache, and as a last resort all weeks’ `players_by_week` to avoid raw IDs.
- Best/Worst Drop
  - Weekly points of the dropped player (on roster or FA) with the same week windows.
- Worst Start/Sit
  - Largest eligible bench-over-starter delta.
- Weekly Best/Worst Trade
  - Player‑for‑player only (requires ≥1 pro player on both sides). Multi‑team trades supported. Net computed from that week’s points.

### Season‑to‑Date Trade Leader
- Normalize trades with `trade_id` and `trade_ts`.
- Exclude pick‑only sides.
- Carry‑forward aggregation: a trade contributes weekly net (players_received − players_sent) from the execution week through the report week.
- PDF/log detail uses only players from contributing `trade_id`(s) and includes the ids for cross‑reference.

### Best of the Rest (BOR)
- Builds optimal FA lineup and compares to each team.
- Prior weeks reuse cached FA files under `output/data/<season>/<platform>/<league>/week_<n>/free_agents.json` (no re‑query).
- PDF includes lineup, weekly record, and optional season summary tables.

### PDF/UX
- All table cells are Paragraphs with word wrap and middle alignment to prevent overflow or clipping.
- Weekly Awards reflowed into titled subsections; spacing/widths improved.

## Diagnostics (How to Verify)
- Windows: “Fleaflicker week windows for season …”
- Per‑item mapping: “Activity map/skip …” and “TeamTx map/skip …”
- Week summaries: “Tx summary week N: adds=… claims=… drops=… trades=…”
- Weekly award inputs: “Week N awards candidates …; FA sample: …”
- Season trades (carry‑forward): “Trade Szn add: team=… trade=<id> week=<wk> net=… ts=…”
- Pick‑only filters/season window skips logged at INFO.

## Known/Handled Edge Cases
- Per‑team transactions with type=null → treated as Add.
- Early‑season coverage: per‑team paging continues until before Week 1 start.
- Off‑season trades mapped to Week 1; (optional) can add a setting to exclude them entirely if desired.
- Player IDs in awards resolved via cross‑week lookup when not found in current/previous or FA cache.

## Options / Future Tweaks
- Add a `.env` setting to offset week starts by hours (e.g., Tuesday 10:00) if a non‑midnight boundary is preferred.
- Add a toggle to exclude all off‑season trades from the season award instead of mapping them to Week 1.
- Include trade_id in all “skip” logs (currently trade_id is present in all “add” logs; easy to extend).
- Expand Weekly Trade detail to show more than two names or list top multiple trades for ties.

## File Pointers
- Weekly Awards logic: `ffmwr/report/data.py`
- Season trade carry‑forward and PDF detail: `ffmwr/report/builder.py`
- Fleaflicker normalization/mapping/caching: `ffmwr/dao/platforms/fleaflicker.py`
- PDF generator and section layout: `ffmwr/report/pdf/generator.py`
- Changelog (this session’s work): `CHANGELOG.md`

## Quick Sanity Checklist
- Set `LOG_LEVEL=info` (or `debug`) for visibility.
- Confirm windows & mapping in logs before trusting FA/trade awards.
- Ensure FA caches exist for BOR (prior weeks won’t re‑query).
- For season award, verify contributing `trade_id`(s) match Fleaflicker trades you expect to count.

This summary is intended to be a fast “restore context” reference when resuming work.
